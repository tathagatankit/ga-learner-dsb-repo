### Project Overview

 This project is about Student Management System at a very very basic level.


### Learnings from the project

 This project required basics of Python like List, Dictionary, Operators etc. So, I learned use of the basics in a good manner.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The following approach was taken :
1. Make a student Register.
2. Find out who scored highest marks in Mathmematics.
3. Format the name of the topper according to format of the certificate.


### Challenges faced

 Since the project required extensive use of Dictionary, knowing all of its functions was bit hard in the beginning. I looked for some external sources and then tried different approaches and finally came up with this.


### Additional pointers

 Dictionary is a boon for Python Programmers.
